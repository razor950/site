title: Welcome to Razor's Playground!

Alright, this is my first post on here and I will discuss a bit of everything from why I start this site to where I expect to go with it. Please bear with me while I get used to understanding markdown better. I shall be blogging on a variety of topics such as game development, in specific Unreal Engine 4 ins and outs while working on the project [Killing, My Friend](https://killingmyfriendgame.com).

## Hello World
I think its appropriate that I begin this in how it all started. I've been meaning to have a place to write up my thoughts, concerns, learnings and knowledge to interact with the world. I finally decided that instead of doing the usual of discussing how I'd structure the site and all of that. I would just avoid doing all this design work which usually ends up as never getting done and just get to it. It was time to move onwards to new beginnings and thus we are here now. 

## It's alive!
I scrapped out a ton of what I was going to do and decided I needed to just have something simple that fits my needs. I wanted to host it on github pages, so I needed whatever solution outputs a static page with the features I want. While I did some digging, I stumbled on a few different solutions and decided to go with Hexo because its one of the few written in Javascript. I did take some time to look into its features and was surprised to notice it had a pretty extensive library of plugins and themes. I found a theme that adds features to Hexo and that I deeply enjoy for its simplicty look yet has all the features needed. I learned how to use Hexo and control its settings along with installing a new theme and controlling its own settings. 

## Does it statisfy?
I have to say even thought its still early, I've only just went live with this site as of a day. I am quite impressed with its features, I don't see myself moving away from it to be honest. I have ridiculous amount of control on almost anything I need or want to customize to fit my needs. I've made some custom changes but those haven't been too crazy yet, things like color scheme and font; which I am not sure I'll keep yet, feel like a better font could be choosen so I'll spend some time in the next few days testing out different ones, along with some other changes to the site.

## So whats next?
Well aside from changes that I'll make to the site, I don't have an actual timetable as to when I'll have the next post or what the next post will be about yet. I am doing this as I go along with the workload that I have on a day to day basis. I will be focusing on tech related posts and am currently doing quite a bit aside from the UE4 Project, such as assisting friends with learning Javascript and I am learning Rust myself. I apologize if any of the above has been difficult to follow given the font or formatting of markdown text, I am slowly getting the hand of it but it might take a few more writings to fully iron it out.
